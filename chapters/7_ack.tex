\section{Inspirations}
Michaela Štolová's \textit{UCube - mobilní aplikace pro speedcubing (2020)} \cite{Stolova2020}, Vilém Gutvald's \textit{Tower Defense Game with Procedurally Generated Content and Rogue-like Elements (2024)} \cite{Gutvald2024} and Martin Vejbora's \textit{Carty – Arcade Racing Game (2020)} \cite{Vejbora2020} bachelor theses have been used as a source for inspiration on the thesis structure and content due to the similarity of the subject matter.

\section{Use of AI in the thesis and in the project}
The AI tool ChatGPT-4 has been used sparingly during the writing of this thesis. It has been used to help find a suitable word or expression for sentences to avoid unnatural phrasing. No text has been generated by it directly. It had been used to try to debug some parts of the project code.
