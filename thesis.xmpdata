\Keywords{Unity\sep framework\sep 2D game \sep point-and-click adventure game}
\Subject{This thesis implements a C\# framework for 2D point-and-click adventure games built in the Unity engine. While similar tools exist in the Unity Asset store, point-and-click adventure games often rely on custom-built solutions, and there is still value in creating a lightweight, adaptable framework that can serve as both a development aid and a learning resource. It allows game developers to streamline the development of fundamental gameplay systems typical of the genre. At the same time, it offers flexibility and customizable components to accommodate a wide range of artistic styles and narrative structures. The framework provides core mechanics commonly found in point-and-click adventures such as a walking system, dialogue system, inventory system, and more. To showcase how the framework works in practice, two simple prototype games were created using its features. While the framework is not fully complete and does not include every mechanic a finished game might need, it provides a solid foundation and a starting point for future improvements and additional functionality.}
