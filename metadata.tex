\def\AbstractEN{%
\xxx{Abstracts are an abstract form of art. Use the most precise, shortest sentences that state what problem the thesis addresses, how it is approached, pinpoint the exact result achieved, and describe the applications and significance of the results. Highlight anything novel that was discovered or improved by the thesis. Maximum length is 200 words, but try to fit into 120. Abstracts are often used for deciding if a reviewer will be suitable for the thesis; a well-written abstract thus increases the probability of getting a reviewer who will like the thesis.}
% ABSTRACT IS NOT A COPY OF YOUR THESIS ASSIGNMENT!

\def\AbstractCS{%
\xxx{You will need to submit both Czech and English abstract to the SIS, no matter what language you use in the thesis. If writing in English, translate the contents of \texttt{\textbackslash{}AbstractEN} into this field. In case you do not speak czech, your supervisor should be able to help you with the translation.}
